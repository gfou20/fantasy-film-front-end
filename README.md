## About

Welcome to Fantasy Filmmaking!

Have you ever watched a movie and wondered if another actor could have done the role better? Well wonder no more as Fantasy Filmmaking allows the user to pick their favorite movies and edit the cast with our DreamCast function. Add any actor/actress to any movie you can think of to create your dream movie!

Inspiration for this app came from my group's love for movies and wondering how we could create a fun application using this passion.

Hope you enjoy!
